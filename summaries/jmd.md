JMD's online view has a nice feature where you can expand the abstracts. I'm not including them, but it makes for an easy way to scan an issue.

Research Papers
---------------

### User-Centered Design Customization of Rugby Wheelchairs Based on the Taguchi Method

*Clara C. Usma-Alvarez, Franz K. Fuss and Aleksandar Subic* J. Mech. Des. 136, 041001 (2014) (); doi:10.1115/1.4026029

Custom wheelchair design for wheelchair rugby. That's "murderball", right? Anyway, they took actual people and did a DOE on wheelchair design for each of them. As always, respect for people who go out and do actual physical measurements!

### A Function Based Approach for Product Integration

*Vishwa Kalyanasundaram and Kemper Lewis* J. Mech. Des. 136, 041002 (2014) (); doi:10.1115/1.4026032

Reconfigurable / multifunction products. A drill / dustbuster chimera.

### Value-Based Global Optimization

*Roxanne A. Moore, David A. Romero and Christiaan J. J. Paredis* J. Mech. Des. 136, 041003 (2014) (); doi:10.1115/1.4026281

Surrogate modeling, multi-fidelity modeling. Surrogate gives more weight to data from higher fidelity models. Then it looks like they optimize a utility function. No clue about the application. Sounds similar to what I had in mind for MEME, except it stops when it decides the information isn't valuable any more.

Fulltext access to JMD was broken for a while, so I downloaded (Moore 2012), about which I had [a lot to say](moore_2012_valuebased.md).

### The Impact of Team-Based Product Dissection on Design Novelty

*Christine A. Toh, Scarlett R. Miller and Gül E. Okudan Kremer* J. Mech. Des. 136, 041004 (2014) (); doi:10.1115/1.4026151

Very much about the social issues around design. Which is great, actually, well done! Not my area, though, moving on.

Technical Brief
---------------

### Multi-Objective Design Optimization of a Variable Geometry Spray Fuel Injector

*J. R. Archer, Tiegang Fang, Scott Ferguson and Gregory D. Buckner* J. Mech. Des. 136, 044501 (2014) (); doi:10.1115/1.4026263

Simulation (CFD) based design optimization of a fuel injector. Using MOGA! DOE for factor screening. I'd like to read this one too. And it turns out it's an MS thesis by Mr. Archer. How convenient!
