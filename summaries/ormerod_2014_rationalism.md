Abstract
--------

Looking to Karl Popper's Critical Rationalism as a way to salvage OR's claim to be a rational, scientific decision-making approach. Popper's intersubjective consensus as a model for group decision-making?

Introduction
------------

A different take on rationality from what we're used to seeing. Rather than maximizing expected value, we're looking at deductive logic as the key feature of rationality. These views are not necessarily incompatible, depending on your deductive premises. Philosopher David Miller has been working on applying CR to decision-making, as opposed to science. (Surely this is a bit of a false distinction? Doesn't scientific induction *require* decisions to be taken? At the very least you have to decide what to study.) He and Ormerod would like to "eliminate, avoid, or tame" subjectivity. They arrive in the end at subjectivity being necessary (to address "normative issues").

I take issue with Popper's account of subjectivity (as related here by Ormerod). The idea is that we have access to some kind of non-subjective rationality against which we can judge the subjectivity of others. That's both arrogant and impossible. Making a completely dispassionate, omniscient view the standard of rationality means we're all irrational, except presumably for the OR practitioner who has somehow gained access to this kind of inhuman rationality.

The middle sections
-------------------

Popper doesn't have a coherent idea of how "practice" happens. I put in the scare quotes because, as I mentioned, I'm not sold on the distinction between science and practice. Kuhn among others have criticized Popper on similar grounds. By framing science and rationality as purely deductive, Popper has painted himself in a corner. Either you have to admit that some kind of induction exists and is rational, or you have to conclude that scientists have decided what to study based purely on some irrational whim.

Miller takes less of a hard line against induction, but he's not exactly for it and he particularly disagrees with making "positive and justificatory claims." What room, exactly, this leaves for induction isn't clear, except that he admits the possibility that things which have happened in the past might happen, in a similar way, in the future.

Ormerod wants to escape from the corner CR is painted into with respect to decisions by appealing to exactly what I've called out as a false dichotomy --- science versus action. Basically, his point is that, since scientists have to decide what hypotheses to critique, they must do it *somehow*. However they are doing it must be scientific, because they are scientists, yet subjective, because they are people, and so we should look to their example in decision science.

Ormerod looks at coping strategies for dealing with subjectivity. **Strategy 1** is two tiered. Somebody at the higher level makes the subjective decisions, setting up rules and frameworks within people at the lower level can work entirely deductively in accordance with CR. **Strategy 2** has experts use their judgment. **Strategy 3** is to even out subjectivity by getting so many people involved that their collective point of view approaches objectivity. (N heads are better than one?)

Ormerod then goes on to basically summarize the whole field of OR. I think he's trying to make the case that what OR people do really is, in accordance with CR, about managing subjectivity. Really, I think he's defined his problem in such a way that he can answer that OR is the answer to it. Which, from his point of view, is good because it means that he now has a rationalistic account of decision-making.

Conclusions
-----------

It took me until the end of the paper to understand the trick he pulls off. So long as you work from the premise that CR is the only form of rationality, that induction has no role in science or decision making, that deduction is the defining feature of rational thought, this all makes sense. We need to manage subjectivity, and if you look at it from the CR perspective, that's what OR is all about. Therefore, OR *is* CR applied to practice, and OR practitioners can sleep at night knowing that theirs is a rational, scientific approach.

My criticism is that this worldview assigns altogether too little validity to what it calls "subjectivity", which is any knowledge, value judgment, or perspective not produced by deduction. Premises, and even data, have to come from somewhere, and there's no coherent deductive account of where. I think we'd be better off acknowledging that induction happens and that it is necessarily the basis for a great deal of knowledge, despite not having a deductive explanation for how it works. This is the philosophical problem of induction. Nobody's solved it yet, but dismissing induction as "subjectivity", lumping it together with bias and emotional thinking doesn't make dealing with it any easier.
