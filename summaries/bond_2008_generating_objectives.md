Generating Objectives: Can Decision Makers Articulate What They Want?
=====================================================================

Cite (Bond, Carlson, and Keeney 2008).

"Overall, our research suggests that decision makers are considerably deficient in utilizing personal knowledge and values to form objectives for the decisions they face."

People are bad at saying what it is they want, not only because they have difficulty expressing it, but also because they are not fully conscious of it.

The Studies
-----------

Questionnaires about objectives, plus re-evaluation given a master list:

-   For the choice of a B-school
-   For the choice of a B-school, with a week's delay after the initial questionnaire
-   For the choice of a summer internship
-   Case study: Seagate corporate objectives

Conclusions
-----------

-   The conclusion ties, although not explicitly, to cognitive hysteresis and myopia: "individuals become mired in an overly narrow mental representation that prevents them from considering a comprehensive set of objectives."
-   This also means that it's terribly unwise for the analyst to optimize objectives received directly from a client, without considering the broader scope of objectives.
-   In a way, this flips Arrow on his head --- we can and should get a broader set of objectives by consulting more stakeholders. (They don't draw the link to Arrow.)

Comments
--------

-   There's nothing here about using modeling and optimization to expand the scope of the objectives.
