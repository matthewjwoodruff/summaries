Approximation Concepts for Optimum Structural Design -- A Review
================================================================

Cite (Barthelemy and Haftka 1993).

A review paper covering approximations (the term metamodeling was not yet in use) in structural optimization.

Kinds of approximation
----------------------

-   Response surface models
-   Neural nets
-   Upper / lower bounds
-   Simplistic model (e.g. lumped rather than finite-element model)
-   Intermediate variables
-   Of particular interest to me, *reducing the design space*
-   Midrange (multipoint and local-global) approximations
-   Toropov did something similar in spirit to MEME: *successive response surface approximations at higher resolution for smaller parts of the design space*

Conclusions
-----------

-   At the time computational cost and precision of these approaches had not been systematically measured.
