## A survey of structural and multidisciplinary continuum topology optimization: post 2000

 *Joshua D. Deaton, Ramana V. Grandhi Pages 1-38*

Topology optimization is trying to optimize the size and placement of voids in a structure.
It's where all of those pictures of fuzzy trusses come from.
It's really hard.
They do have some evolutionary methods ("hard-kill" and "soft-kill"), but it seems like these use old-school binary-coded GAs and all of the sophistication goes into the analysis side.
Special-purpose solvers exist and seem to be the standard.
An interesting representation inspired by biological cell division has emerged, and is compatible with GAs.
