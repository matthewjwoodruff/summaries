I've copy-pasted the TOC and I'm adding some comments to each article to get a feel for where the community is.

### A survey of structural and multidisciplinary continuum topology optimization: post 2000

 *Joshua D. Deaton, Ramana V. Grandhi Pages 1-38*

Topology optimization is trying to optimize the size and placement of voids in a structure.
It's where all of those pictures of fuzzy trusses come from.
It's really hard.
They do have some evolutionary methods ("hard-kill" and "soft-kill"), but it seems like these use old-school binary-coded GAs and all of the sophistication goes into the analysis side.
Special-purpose solvers exist and seem to be the standard.
An interesting representation inspired by biological cell division has emerged, and is compatible with GAs.

### Parameter-free optimum design method of stiffeners on thin-walled structures
 *Yang Liu, Masatoshi Shimoda Pages 39-47*

Skipped --- not interested in other people's new optimization methods at the moment, but in how they're using existing methods.

### Rules for trajectory updating in decision based design
 *Vijitashwa Pandey, Zissimos P. Mourelatos Pages 49-57*

I had no idea what DBD was before just now.
Basically it couples a single objective optimizer with software that asks the user for rankings periodically.
The idea is to figure out the user's utility function.
(Based on the assumption that such a thing exists and that it is possible to determine it.)
This sounds similar to something Ravi Ravindran mentioned in his class.

Anyway, the upshot is that people doing single-objective stuff seem to be
