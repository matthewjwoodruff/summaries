Literature Summaries
====================

The markdown files in this repository are summaries of literature I've read. Mostly, these relate to optimization and decision-making. This includes multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), design optimization, and operations research.

Citing
======

I strongly encourage you to read the originals --- I make no guarantee that my notes are free of bias or omission. If you do use material from these summaries, please cite them. [tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3587/how-can-i-use-bibtex-to-cite-a-web-page) has a good discussion of how to cite web pages. The following example may be used with BibTex. Be sure to fill in the date of access.

    @misc{woodruff_literature_summaries,
        title = {Literature Summaries},
        author = {Matthew Woodruff},

        note = {Accessed: yyyy-mm-dd}

Journal Scans
=============

These summarize recent issues of a journal.

-   [Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization](summaries/smo.md)
-   [Journal of Mechanical Design](summaries/jmd.md)
-   [European Journal of Operational Research](summaries/ejor.md)
-   [Evolutionary Computation](summaries/ec.md)

Individual Articles
===================

These are summaries of individual articles.

[Barthelemy and Haftka, 1993](summaries/barthelemy_haftka_1993_approximation_concepts.md) : A review paper covering approximations in structural optimization.

[Bond et al, 2008](summaries/bond_2008_generating_objectives.md) : People are bad at expressing what it is they want, and they might not even know.

[Ormerod, 2014](summaries/ormerod_2014_rationalism.md) : Critical Rationalism, deriving from Popper's deductive rationalism, offers OR practitioners a way to say that their methods are rational and scientific.

[Saltelli, 2014](summaries/saltelli_2014_modelswrong.md) : Sensitivity auditing. Systematic approach to looking for the agenda behind a model.

[Wu and Azarm, 2001](summaries/azarm_2001_metrics.md) : Multi-objective optimization metrics for engineering design. Valuable for its context in time (2001) and place (JMD). Chapter 5 of (**???**) is pretty definitive if you just want to know about metrics.

I've put some of the citations in a [BibTeX database](src/bibliography.bib).
