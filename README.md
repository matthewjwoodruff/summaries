Citing
======

I strongly encourage you to read the originals --- I make no guarantee that my notes are free of bias or omission.  If you do use material from these summaries, please cite them.  ![tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3587/how-can-i-use-bibtex-to-cite-a-web-page) has a good discussion of how to cite web pages.  The following example may be used with BibTex --- be sure to fill in the date of access.

```

    title = {Literature Summaries},
    author = {Matthew Woodruff},
    howpublished = {https://github.com/matthewjwoodruff/summaries},
