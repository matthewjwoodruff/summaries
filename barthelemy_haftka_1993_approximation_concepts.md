A review paper covering approximations (the term metamodeling was not yet in use) in structural optimization.

## Kinds of approximation

* Response surface models
* Neural nets
* Upper / lower bounds
* Simplistic model (e.g. lumped rather than finite-element model)
* Intermediate variables
* Of particular interest to me, *reducing the design space*
* Midrange (multipoint and local-global) approximations
* Toropov did something similar in spirit to MEME: *successive response surface approximations at higher resolution for smaller parts of the design space*

## Conclusions

* At the time computational cost and precision of these approaches had not been systematically measured.
