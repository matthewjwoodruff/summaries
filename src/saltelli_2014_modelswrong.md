# When All Models are Wrong

Cite [@saltelli_2014_modelswrong].

# Summary

Badly done science gives science a bad name.
    Ideologues everywhere are happy to use this as a pretext to attack science they don't like.
    Quoting Box, of course, "All models are wrong but some are useful."
    The real challenge, then, is using them responsibly.
    To this end, Saltelli proposes sensitivity auditing to keep people honest.
    And naturally, global sensitivity analysis is an important part.

Basically, he sets out some rules for using and evaluating models, with the goal of avoiding misuse and detecting bad models.
    And he sees a natural and appropriate use for global sensitivity analysis, which he's not too shy to point out.
