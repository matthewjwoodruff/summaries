# Literature Summaries

The markdown files in this repository are summaries of literature I've read.
    Mostly, these relate to optimization and decision-making.
    This includes multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), design optimization, and operations research.

# Citing

I strongly encourage you to read the originals --- I make no guarantee that my notes are free of bias or omission.
If you do use material from these summaries, please cite them.  [tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3587/how-can-i-use-bibtex-to-cite-a-web-page)
has a good discussion of how to cite web pages.  The following example may be used with BibTex --- be sure to fill in the date of access.
