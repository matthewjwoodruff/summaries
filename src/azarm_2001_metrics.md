# Metrics for Quality Assessment of a Multiobjective Design Optimization Solution Set

Cite [@azarm_2001_metrics]

Surprising to me that I've never heard of Azarm's group's work.
    They do multi-objective optimization.
    They talk about the S-metric / hypervolume / hyperarea / Lebesgue measure back in 2001, which is quite forward-looking.
    In other papers, they talks about robust optimization, customer design, and metamodeling.
    Seems like they're totally on the right track.

The intro cites [@zitzler_1998_comparative], so they know the contemporary MOEA literature.
    There's nothing really new in the contents for me --- first 5 pages introduce the need for metrics and discuss some now standard ones.
    Pages 6-7 show a simple 2-objective vibrating platform example and metrics for it.
    Page 8 is conclusion, acknowledgments, and refs, and that's all there is.
    But to summarize things this way is to lose sight of the fact that this stuff, in 2001, and really even in 2014, is mostly unknown to the audience they're addressing.
    (Sometimes it even feels like I'm at the tail end of a fad that never really caught on, but maybe that's Hazelrigg's chilling effect on MO techniques in engineering design.)
