# Note

"Isn't this quite a lot of articles?", I asked myself when I pulled the TOC.
    "Is this journal published quarterly or something?"
    No, as it turns out, this journal is published *twice every month*.
    No wonder it took forever to get Ruchit's paper published.
    They're trying to turn over a huge volume of material.

## Invited Review

### Recent advances in robust optimization: An overview
 *Review Article*
 *Pages 471-483*
 *Virginie Gabrel, Cécile Murat, Aurélie Thiele*

It looks like they're considering deep uncertainty: "robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions".

## Continuous Optimization

### The multicriteria p-facility median location problem on networks
 *Original Research Article*
 *Pages 484-493*
 *Jörg Kalcsics, Stefan Nickel, Miguel A. Pozo, Justo Puerto, Antonio M. Rodríguez-Chía*

It's at least a true two-objective approach.
    Basically facility location.
    I'm not too keen on papers of this sort, because I think they've abstracted away all of the interesting parts of the problem.

### The self regulation problem as an inexact steepest descent method for multicriteria optimization
 *Original Research Article*
 *Pages 494-502*
 *G.C. Bento, J.X. Cruz Neto, P.R. Oliveira, A. Soubeyran*

Not sure what the self regulation problem is, or how a problem can be a method.
    But at least, multicriteria, and possibly multiobjective with multiple starts?

### Nonsmooth multiobjective programming with quasi-Newton methods
 *Original Research Article*
 *Pages 503-510*
 *Shaojian Qu, Chen Liu, Mark Goh, Yijun Li, Ying Ji*

Multiobjective, but does not appear to admit black-box models?
