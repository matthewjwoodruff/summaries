JMD's online view has a nice feature where you can expand the abstracts.
I'm not including them, but it makes for an easy way to scan an issue.

## Research Papers

### User-Centered Design Customization of Rugby Wheelchairs Based on the Taguchi Method
*Clara C. Usma-Alvarez, Franz K. Fuss and Aleksandar Subic*
J. Mech. Des. 136, 041001 (2014) ();   doi:10.1115/1.4026029

Custom wheelchair design for wheelchair rugby.
That's "murderball", right?
Anyway, they took actual people and did a DOE on wheelchair design for each of them.
As always, respect for people who go out and do actual physical measurements!

### A Function Based Approach for Product Integration
*Vishwa Kalyanasundaram and Kemper Lewis*
J. Mech. Des. 136, 041002 (2014) ();   doi:10.1115/1.4026032

Reconfigurable / multifunction products. A drill / dustbuster chimera.

### Value-Based Global Optimization
*Roxanne A. Moore, David A. Romero and Christiaan J. J. Paredis*
J. Mech. Des. 136, 041003 (2014) ();   doi:10.1115/1.4026281

Surrogate modeling, multi-fidelity modeling.  Surrogate gives more weight to data from higher fidelity models.
Then it looks like they optimize a utility function.
No clue about the application.
Sounds similar to what I had in mind for MEME, except it stops when it decides the information isn't valuable any more.

Fulltext access to JMD was broken for a while, so I downloaded [@moore_2012_valuebased], about which I had [a lot to say](moore_2012_valuebased.md).


### The Impact of Team-Based Product Dissection on Design Novelty
 *Christine A. Toh, Scarlett R. Miller and GÃ¼l E. Okudan Kremer*
J. Mech. Des. 136, 041004 (2014) ();   doi:10.1115/1.4026151

Very much about the social issues around design.
    Which is great, actually, well done!
    Not my area, though, moving on.

## Technical Brief

### Multi-Objective Design Optimization of a Variable Geometry Spray Fuel Injector
 *J. R. Archer, Tiegang Fang, Scott Ferguson and Gregory D. Buckner*
J. Mech. Des. 136, 044501 (2014) ();   doi:10.1115/1.4026263

Simulation (CFD) based design optimization of a fuel injector.
    Using MOGA!
    DOE for factor screening.
    I'd like to read this one too.
    And it turns out it's an MS thesis by Mr. Archer.  How convenient!
